            <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
                And sorry I could not travel both
                And be one traveler, long I stood
                And looked down one as far as I could
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;
                <br><br>
                Then took the other, as just as fair,
                And having perhaps the better claim,
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
                Though as for that the passing there
                Had worn them really about the same,
                <br><br>
                And both that morning equally lay
                In leaves no step had trodden black.
                Oh, I kept the first for another day!
                Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
                I doubted if I should ever come back.
                <br><br>
                I shall be telling this with a sigh
                Somewhere ages and ages hence:
                Two roads diverged in a wood, and I
                I took the one less traveled by,
                And that has made all the difference</p>
